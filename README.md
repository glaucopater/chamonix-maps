# A Chamonix Maps SPA implemented with React, Redux, React Router, Styled Components...

Unit tests are present, for them I used Jest + Enzyme.

For styling after a first prototype in plain CSS I decided to adopt Styled Components, which perform very well and allows to customize any single components.
The main page is a grid designed with CSS Grid, the page is responsive, so even on mobile devices the SPA is visible.
